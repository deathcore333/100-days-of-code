# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: Abril 2, 2022

Working on C++. I diving into the C++ language, starting from 0 and going to 100.
The jump functin pointer is a C++ feature that allows you to jump to a different function, i found it really usefull.

**Today's Progress**: Create jump table of function pointers.

**Thoughts:** i work on prototypes using a main.h to link all the code but the function array pointer type is not possible to describe in header without a array size, i fix it adding in the same file where it's called.

**Link to work:** [function pointers array](https://github.com/ralexrivero/cpp/tree/main/02-functions/22-jump_table)

## Day 1: Abril 3, 2022

Discovering more on C++. In the general overview a see the following topics:

- Functions
  - Function signatures for name overloading.
  - Overloading operators
  - Variadic functions
  - Recursion
- Preprocessor
  - macros as constants
  - macros

**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts:**

**Link to work:** []()
