# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: August 21, 2022

Use recursion to handle the matrix concatenation trough an axis.

**Today's Progress**: use the python standard library.

**Thoughts:** i work on prototypes using a main.h to link all the code but the function array pointer type is not possible to describe in header without a array size, i fix it adding in the same file where it's called.

## Day 1: August 22, 2022

Use Makefile to compile C project. The main goal of the project is to insert in a linked list.

**Today's Progress**: Automate the compilation using Makefile.

**Thoughts:** Works excelent for compilation and cleaning the project. I think that i need to automate the compilation with different entry points (i.e. 0-main.c, 1-main.c, 2-main.c, ...) and the Makefile will be the same for all the entry points. I will implement in the next C project.

## Day 2: August 23, 2022

Solve the following problem:
`You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.`

**Today's Progress**: solve the problem using python.

**Thoughts:** the problem has lot of thinking and whitboarding and the solution is simple.
